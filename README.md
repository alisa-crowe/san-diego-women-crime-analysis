# BDA594 Project

## Overview

This repository contains the Fall 2024 BDA 594 Group 4 project focused on analyzing crimes against women in San Diego County and building predictive models related to incident outcomes.

**Group Members:**  
- Alisa Crowe  
- Rita Herfi  
- Sam Keppler

## Objective

The project aims to:

- Explore crime patterns affecting women in San Diego County
- Understand factors correlated with incidents
- Build predictive models to assess risk or classify incident outcomes
- Visualize feature importance to interpret model behavior

This involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and predictive machine learning.

## Data

The dataset includes crime records relevant to women in San Diego County. Details like source, variables, and preprocessing steps (cleaning, encoding, splitting) are documented in notebooks or the `documents/` folder. The `data/` directory contains both raw and processed data used across analyses. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Incident Prediction

The `incident-predictor/` directory contains code for building and evaluating predictive models related to incident outcomes. This likely includes scripts for model training, evaluation, and possibly deployment. Refer to that folder’s internal README or notebooks for usage and details. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Visualizations

The repo includes feature importance plots:

- `feature_importance_dv.png`  
- `feature_importance_incident.png`

These visualize which features most influenced the models’ predictions. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
